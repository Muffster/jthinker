jThinker is a free software, so everyone can use it!
Moreover, it's so free that everyone can develop it as well!

However, to use it effectively you should know the Theory of Constraints ideas, without them jThinker is just a tool for drawing boxes. So, here I list several TOC books that I value high myself.

 * Eliyahu M. Goldratt. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0884271781?ie=UTF8&tag=jthinkersoftw-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0884271781">The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jthinkersoftw-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0884271781" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. A very inspiring business novel that contains the core ideas of TOC. The book that any TOC practioner have to start with.
