*jThinker 0.3.3, Feb 04 2009*

The major improvements since WhatsNew_0_3_1 are:

  * Node grouping.
 
  * Automatic un-overlapping of nodes in the diagram.
 
  * Export to JPG and PNG files.

  * Assumptions are now allowed on all diagrams



Several broken things were fixed:

  * Major rewrite of save/load of files. Now this part seems to be error-prone

  * Conflict resolution diagram allows the lightning-like lines

  * Assumptions are allowed for all kinds of diagrams
